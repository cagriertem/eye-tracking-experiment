In this study, we investigate the connection between photography and visual perception through the medium of Gestalt theory. Gestalt theory, which emphasizes the human mind’s innate ability to organize visual stimuli into structured and meaningful wholes, offers valuable insights into understanding how compositional elements in photography create unity, balance, and aesthetic appeal. Principles such as similarity, proximity, continuity, and figure-ground not only shape our interpretation of visual stimuli but also guide viewer attention in artistic compositions. While Gestalt principles have been extensively applied in design, architecture, and visual communication, their application to photographic arts remains relatively unexplored. Furthermore, there are a limited number of studies that investigate the impact of Gestalt properties through eye tracking experiments and deep learning models. Eye-tracking metrics, including fixations, saccades, and attention maps, are novel tools that provide extensive analyses of visual attention and perception. This study aims to bridge the gap between Gestalt theoretical principles and empirical evidence by exploring how Gestalt principles influence viewer attention and contribute to the aesthetic impact of photography. In other terms, our aim is to test the impact of Gestalt properties and investigate whether there is a significant difference between Gestalt properties in terms of certain eye tracking metrics. We claim that there is a significant difference between four Gestalt properties, namely, proximity, similarity, figure-ground and continuity. To prove this, in addition to statistical tests, we compare three different pre-trained deep learning models (ResNet50, EfficientNet and VGG16) that analyze the heat maps derived from eye tracking data. By combining computational methods with psychological theory, this research aims to give insights about the distinctive features of photographic composition that affect visual perception by providing a reasonable foundation for our understanding of the relationship between perception, aesthetics, and art.
